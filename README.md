This google colab contatins the source code for the OCR model, it is split into different sections, each containing distict functions that are used for those operateions (eg. setup, preprocessing, etc...)

The main section contains three blocks; the first initialises the necessary driver functions, the second is for single document analysis, in which the user uploads a jpeg for analysis, and the third is for performing OCR on the dataset, and calcualting evaluation metrics.
