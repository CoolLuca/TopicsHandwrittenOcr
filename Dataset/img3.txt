Properties of MSTs

An MST of a given graph G can be
constructed by Greedy Algorithms

Crucial Properties:
cut property
Let e be an edge of minimum cost in
a cut C.
Then there is an MST that contains e

Cycle property
an edge of maximal cost in any
cycle does not need to be considered
for computing an MST
