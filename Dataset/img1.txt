Dynamic Programming
Most problems involve optimisation, ie finding
a soln that maximises/minimises some function
Algorithms for optimisation problems require
proof that they return the best possible solutions.
Greedy algorithms make the best local decision
at each step & are efficient but dont find
the global optimum
Exaustive search try all possiblity & select
the best/most optimum, but are super slow

Dynamic programming involve designing algorithms
that systematically store all possibilities
(guarentee correctness) while storing results
